**********************
**    HYPOTHESIS    **
**********************
Would players first follow an obvious main path laid out in front of them, or would they immediately branch off to follow side paths before reaching the end goal on the main path?



**********************
**      DESIGN      **
**********************
Create a main path that leads to end goal, one smaller path that branches off that ends up at the same place, and another path that branches off to something else.



**********************
**  PLAYTEST NOTES  **
**********************
- Everyone branched out immediately upon seeing the side path
- Exploring side quests/loot before finishing with the main "objective" is common across all 
- Most like to get a lay of the land first before making decisions, explore the map and have all the information to then make an informed decision as to how they want to proceed
- Everyone tried to interact with the objects in some way, so it seems that object design/look/feel will dictate what players will try to do with them
- People look for a purpose, they try things and if it doesn't work, they'll look for a purpose elsewhere (pick up things, interact, jump, patterns, etc.)
- People need a clear goal because of the need for purpose, when launching into the game if it's not self explanatory, there needs to be text



***************************
**  FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS  **
***************************

Could this behaviour be nurtured by the patterns set from so many other games? the rise in popularity of RPGs and the want from all developers for their games to feel natural has created patterns that players now expect. Like moving with WASD, pots are breakable, take the loot because you will need it, etc. These are behaviours and mechanics common and identical across so many games.

The need to explore everything first before finishing with the main quest could also be nurtured behaviour that came to be because of repeated punishment and induce FOMO. not picking up loot or objects and then finishing the main quest blocking out the content you didn't pick up is negative reinforcement, personally, i learn to always pick up EVERYTHING before continuing with the main quests. It seems I even rather do all the side quests first and end with main quests.

That's regarding RPGs and open world games, but I think because they are so popular because of the freedom they provide, the freedom for people to be themselves and to explore and do what they like has engraved a behaviour seen across all genres of games.

**  FUTURE OF THE GAME   **
***************************
- I would create a larger environment, turn it maybe more into a maze to continue to explore the idea of main path and side paths. I would add some objectives and make objects interactable so the players feel that sens of purpose. Come up with a reachable end goal, a puzzle they need to solve

- I should also mind the design of the objects because it's confusing and frustrating to players when objects look like they would do something, but they don't. Most often people get stuck thinking that a special looking item is the answer to their questions, but they just haven't figured it out yet. For attention, make them look intriguing and interesting, for no attention, objects should look mundane and blend into the environment. There's an entire psychology behind these designs...
