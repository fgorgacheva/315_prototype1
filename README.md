# 315_prototype1

Design Hypothesis: Would players first follow an obvious main path laid out in front of them, or would they immediately branch off to follow side paths before reaching the end goal on the main path?

Game Prototype: Create a main path that leads to end goal, one smaller path that branches off that ends up at the same place, and another path that branches off to something else.
